***Algorithms and Runtimes***

Find examples of algorithms with the following time complexity. Places to look include your textbook and the Internet. Create a page in your public portfolio where you list your algorithms by NAME, SOURCE, Explanation. Do NOT include the algorithm itself, just include what it is supposed to do. Prizes for finding algorithms that are truly out there.


| **Time Complexity** | **Name** | **Source** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| O(n) | Getting the sum of the elements in an array | Past classes | To find the sum of all elements in an array, each element is visited once in order, and added to a total value. Hence, it is linear |
| O(log n) | Binary Search | http://bigocheatsheet.com/ | In a sorted array, the number of elements to be searched is halved in each iteration of the search |
| O(n log n) | Mergesort | http://bigocheatsheet.com/ | The unsorted array is divided into two and each one is sorted recursively. All the sorted sub-arrays are merged at the end |
| O(nc)   | Insertion sort- [O(n2)] | http://faculty.simpson.edu/lydia.sinapova/www/cmsc250/LN250\_Weiss/L11-InsSort.htm | Assuming, we have an unsorted array, to insert the ith element, we need at most (i-1) comparisons and (i-1) movements. When the insertion times for all the elements are summed, we get n2 |
| O(cn) | Generating all subsets of a set of n elements - [O(2n)] | http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5508447/2n-complexity-algorithm | The number of subsets of a set of n elements is 2n |
| O(n!) | Generating all permutations of a list/array | [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16555978/example-of-a-factorial-time-algorithm-o-n](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16555978/example-of-a-factorial-time-algorithm-o-n) | The number of permutation of a list is n! |
